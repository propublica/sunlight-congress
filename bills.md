# Bills

Data on bills in Congress goes back to 2009, and comes from a mix of sources:

* Scrapers at [github.com/unitedstates](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) for core status and history information.
* Bulk data at [GPO's FDSys](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/) for version information, and full text.
* The House' [MajorityLeader.gov](http://majorityleader.gov/) and Senate Democrats' [official site](http://democrats.senate.gov/) for notices of upcoming debate.

## Methods

All requests require a valid [API key](index.html#parameters/api-key), and use the domain:

{% highlight text %}
http://congress.api.sunlightfoundation.com
{% endhighlight %}

### /bills

Filter through bills in Congress. Filter by any [fields below](#fields) that have a star next to them. All [standard operators](index.html#parameters/operators) apply.

**Bills enacted into law in the 112th Congress**

{% highlight text %}
/bills?congress=112&history.enacted=true
{% endhighlight %}

**Active bills, ordered by recent activity**
{% highlight text %}
/bills?history.active=true&order=last_action_at
{% endhighlight %}

**Bills sponsored by Republicans that have been vetoed**

{% highlight text %}
/bills?sponsor.party=R&history.vetoed=true
{% endhighlight %}

**Most recent private laws**

{% highlight text %}
/bills?enacted.law_type=private&order=history.enacted_at
{% endhighlight %}

**Joint resolutions that received a vote in the House and Senate**

{% highlight text %}
/bills?bill_type__in=hjres|sjres&history.house_passage_result__exists=true&history.senate_passage_result__exists=true
{% endhighlight %}

### /bills/search

Search the full text of legislation, and other fields.

The `query` parameter allows wildcards, quoting for phrases, and nearby word operators ([full reference](index.html#full-text-search)) You can also retrieve [highlighted excerpts](index.html#full-text-search/highlighting), and all [normal operators](index.html#parameters/operators) and filters.

This searches the bill's full text, `short_title`, `official_title`, `popular_title`, `nicknames`, `summary`, and `keywords` fields.

**Laws matching "health care"**

{% highlight text %}
/bills/search?query="health care"&history.enacted=true
{% endhighlight %}

**Bills matching "freedom of information" and words starting with "accountab"**

{% highlight text %}
/bills/search?query="freedom of information" accountab*
{% endhighlight %}

**Bills with "transparency" and "accountability" within 5 words of each other, with excerpts**

{% highlight text %}
/bills/search?query="transparency accountability"~5&highlight=true
{% endhighlight %}


## Fields

All examples below are from H.R. 3590 of the 111th Congress, the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3590) (Obamacare).

**Many fields are not returned unless requested.** You can request specific fields with the `fields` parameter. See the [partial responses](index.html#parameters/partial-responses) documentation for more details.

### Titles

{% highlight json %}
{
"official_title": "An act entitled The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", 
"popular_title": "Health care reform bill",

    "type": "popular"
  }, 
  {
    "as": "enacted", 
    "title": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", 
    "type": "short"
  }, 
  {
    "as": "amended by senate", 
    "title": "An act entitled The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", 
    "type": "official"
  }
]
}
{% endhighlight %}
**official_title**<br/>
The current official title of a bill. Official titles are sentences. Always present. Assigned at introduction, and can be revised any time.

**short_title**<br/>
The current shorter, catchier title of a bill. About half of bills get these, and they can be assigned any time.

**popular_title**<br/>
The current popular handle of a bill, as denoted by the Library of Congress. They are rare, and are assigned by the LOC for particularly ubiquitous bills. They are non-capitalized descriptive phrases. They can be assigned any time.

**titles**<br/>
A list of all titles ever assigned to this bill, with accompanying data.

**titles.as**<br/>
The state the bill was in when assigned this title.

**titles.title**<br/>
The title given to the bill.

### Nicknames

{% highlight json %}
{
"nicknames": [
  "obamacare",
  "ppaca"
]
}
{% endhighlight %}

\* **nicknames**<br/>
An array of common nicknames for a bill that don't appear in official data. These nicknames are sourced from a public dataset at [unitedstates/bill-nicknames](https://github.com/unitedstates/bill-nicknames), and will only appear for a tiny fraction of bills. In the future, we plan to auto-generate acronyms from bill titles and add them to this array.

### Summary and keywords

{% highlight json %}
{
"subjects": [
  "Abortion", 
  "Administrative law and regulatory procedures", 
  "Adoption and foster care",
  ...
], 

"summary": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - Title I: Quality, Affordable Health Care for All Americans...",

"summary_short": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - Title I: Quality, Affordable Health Care for All Americans..."
}
{% endhighlight %}
\* **keywords**<br/>
A list of official keywords and phrases assigned by the Library of Congress. These keywords can be used to group bills into tags or topics, but there are many of them (1,023 unique keywords since 2009, as of late 2012), and they are not grouped into a hierarchy. They can be assigned or revised at any time after introduction.

**summary**<br/>
An official summary written and assigned at some point after introduction by the Library of Congress. These summaries are generally more accessible than the text of the bill, but can still be technical. The LOC does not write summaries for all bills, and when they do can assign and revise them at any time.

**summary_short**<br/>
The official summary, but capped to 1,000 characters (and an ellipse). Useful when you want to show only the first part of a bill's summary, but don't want to download a potentially large amount of text.

### URLs

{
"urls": {
  "congress" :"http://beta.congress.gov/bill/111th/house-bill/3590",

The **upcoming** field has an array of objects describing when a bill has been scheduled for future debate on the House or Senate floor. Its information is taken from party leadership websites in the [House](http://majorityleader.gov/) and [Senate](http://democrats.senate.gov/), and updated frequently throughout the day.

While this information is official, party leadership in both chambers have unilateral and immediate control over what is scheduled on the floor, and it can change at any time. We do our best to automatically remove entries when a bill has been yanked from the floor schedule.

**upcoming.source_type**<br/>
Where this information is coming from. Currently, the only values are "senate_daily" or "house_daily".

**upcoming.url**<br/>
