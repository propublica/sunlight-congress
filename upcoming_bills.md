# Upcoming Bills

Bills that have been scheduled by party leadership for upcoming House and Senate floor action. House schedules are taken from the [House Majority Leader](http://majorityleader.gov/), and Senate schedules from the [Senate Democratic Caucus](http://democrats.senate.gov/).

This endpoint is future-looking only. Old data on bills scheduled in the past is automatically deleted.

## Methods

All requests require a valid [API key](index.html#parameters/api-key), and use the domain:

"bill_id": "sconres3-113",

"source_type": "senate_daily",
"legislative_day": "2013-01-21",
"range": "day",
"context": "The Senate stands in recess under the provisions of S.Con.Res.3.  The Senate will meet at 11:30am on Monday, January 21, 2013 for the Joint Session for the Inaugural Ceremonies.",

}
{% endhighlight %}

\* **legislative_day**<br/>
The legislative day this bill is scheduled for. Combine with the `range` field to understand precision. May be null.

\* **range**<br/>
How precise this information is. "day", "week", or null. 

* `range` is "day": bill has been scheduled specifically for the `legislative_day`.
* `range` is "week": bill has been scheduled for the "Week of" the `legislative_day`. 
* `range` is null: bill has been scheduled at an indefinite time in the future. (`legislative_day` is null.)

The "legislative day" is a formal construct that is usually, but not always, the same as the calendar day. For example, if a day's session of Congress runs past midnight, the legislative_day will often stay the same as it was before midnight, until that session adjourns. On January 3rd, it is possible that the same legislative_day could span two Congresses. (This occurred in 2013.)

\* **congress**<br/>
The number of the Congress this bill has been scheduled in.

\* **chamber**<br/>
The chamber which has scheduled this bill.

\* **source_type**<br/>

**context**<br/>
(Senate only) Some context for what kind of activity will be occurring to the bill.

**url**<br/>
A permalink for this information. For the House, this may be a PDF.
